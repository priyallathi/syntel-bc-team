                   Facebook-Cambridge Scam
                   
Problem :-

Data of around 87 million facebook users was breached by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

How the problem occured :- 

In summer 2014, Cambridge Analytica a U.K based company hired a professor named Aleksandar Kogan who gathered user's facebook private information  through his app named "This Is Your Digital Life" which is used for survey . When user install the app and give the survey one option came login with facebook and if user login with facebook his private information was captured through that app and that information was used to make psychometric profile of that user and then Kogan integrated profile with photo records and then send this to political parties and used for Trump's campaign for making of voting profile . 

How the problem will be solved by blockchain:-

As we know that facebook is very huge social platform but it is a centralized platform. So it is easy to hack facebook information. 

But today it has become possible through blockchain technology to make facebook a decentralized platform by replicating some of facebook features by building them on the blockchain platform.

The new decentralized platform could have many of the same features, news feed, group interactions, graphs but with a much improved voting process for sorting through fake news and protecting personal data.

Due to blockchain abilities users have much more rights to decide that which data to keep private and which data to keep public  in blockchain. All of user's data would be on blockchain but the data which user want to keep private has to be encrypted with private key and user only have the rights to decrypt that data through key if they want to share with friends or third party apps or user wants to share more data user provides the ability to third party apps to unlock that data.

So through this way user have full control of which information to share or which to not.
